# Hello there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Joseph Mensh, I'm a ME in the mid atlantic region of the United States. This is my free github hosted website I'm trying out different webtools with, as well as sharing what I've been working on.

- ðŸŒ± This past winter, I painted the [vaporwave ninja](https://imgur.com/gallery/gr6SmgZ/) and revived a Honda Shadow 600 after sitting 4 years.
- ðŸ”­ For the remaining Spring and Summer 2024, I'm planning some mixed motorcycle travel.
- ðŸŒ‘ Traveled to see the eclipse in early April and completed the Loudon county gravel roads map in sections.
- ðŸ“« for inquiries concerning custom mechanical design, consultations, advice, current resume: [Joseph@Mensh.ME](mailto:joseph@mensh.me)
