# Hello there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Joseph Mensh, I'm a ME in the mid atlantic region of the United States. This is my free github hosted website I'm trying out different webtools with, as well as sharing what I've been working on.

- ðŸ”­ For this Fall '23, Iâ€™m planning a move to the Richmond, Virginia area to break ground on a homestead project I've had on the back burner for several years.
- ðŸŒ± This Summer, I finished both the [hall tree](https://i.imgur.com/8edBXgC.jpg) (with a black walnut stain I made) and the [motorbike](https://imgur.com/fo4UIzM) rebuild.
- ðŸ“« for inquiries concerning custom mechanical design, consultations, advice, current resume: [Joseph@Mensh.ME](mailto:joseph@mensh.me)
